# Slide 6: Astrobiology Showcase Manifest

> **Note**: These assets are placeholders for 3D models and large images used in the presentation.

## Assets Required

### 1. Solar System Map (`slide6_solar_system.glb`)
*   **Description**: A high-fidelity 3D model of the solar system showing planetary orbits.
*   **Source**: NASA JPL or equivalent.
*   **Purpose**: Demonstrates the "Macro Logic" (Function Type) of the universe as an immutable reference.

### 2. Biological Cell Render (`slide6_micro_cell.glb`)
*   **Description**: An intricate 3D model of a biological cell (mitochondria, nucleus).
*   **Source**: NIH 3D Print Exchange or similar.
*   **Purpose**: Demonstrates the "Micro Logic" (Internal Systems) mirroring the Macro Logic.

## Usage in Presentation

During Slide 6, load these models into the PKC 3D viewer (or browser-based Three.js scene).
*   **Left View**: Solar System (Macro).
*   **Right View**: Micro Cell (Micro).

> "The same logic governing the orbits of planets governs the metabolism of cells."
