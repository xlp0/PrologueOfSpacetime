# MVP Card: The Water Count

> *"To name is to control. We give the water a name so it cannot hide."*

## 0. The Monad as Archetype
**The Water Count** applies **Grammar** to **Arithmetic**. It formalizes the notation of the count.

## 1. The Principle (Abstract Dimension)
*   **Grammar**: The rules of composition and syntax.
*   **Counting Water**: How to impose discrete structure on continuous fluid.

## 2. The Character (Concrete Dimension)
**Role**: The Accountant.
**Mechanism**:
*   Using tokens or knots (Quipu) to represent water debt.
*   Formalizing the "transaction" of water.

## 3. The Evidence (Balanced Dimension)
**Verification**: The physical record that matches the verbal claim.

## 4. Narrative Integration
In **Chapter 9**, we move from determining *how much* (Logic) to *how to record it* (Grammar). **The Water Count** creates the permanent record.
