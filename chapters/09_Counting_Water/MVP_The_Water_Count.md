# MVP: The Schema (Water Count)

> *"Grammar is the law of meaning. In the Brain Factory, if data does not fit the Schema, it is noise."*

## 1. The Brain Factory Role: Standardization
**The Schema** (Grammar of Arithmetic) is the rigid definition of Truth. It defines the "Types" of the Brain Factory.
*   **Input**: Empirical Counts (Ch 1) and Logic (Ch 5).
*   **Operation**: Formalization (Type Definition).
*   **Output**: An **[[MCard Schema]]** (The rules of the ledger).

## 2. GASing Strategy
*   **Menyenangkan (Rhetoric)**: "The Rules of the Game." Every game needs rules to be fair.
*   **Asyik (Logic)**: The "Game" of **Parsing**. Fitting the square peg in the square hole.
*   **Gampang (Grammar)**: **Type Theory**. `data Water = Liters Float | Drops Int`. This reflects the **Kenosis of Language**: To mean something specific, you must surrender the ability to mean everything else. Constraints create meaning.

## 3. Historic Verification (The Commit Log)
We ground this in the history of **Standardization**.

### Historical Anchors
1.  **Gottlob Frege (1848–1925)**: The Father of Analytic Philosophy. He attempted to derive all arithmetic from logic. While Gödel showed limits, Frege's rigorous **Schema** definition underpins our Token Types.
2.  **Alonzo Church (1903–1995)**: The creator of **Lambda Calculus**. He proved that "Computation" is just the manipulation of symbols according to Grammar. His logic powers our **Functional Specs**.
3.  **Noam Chomsky (1928–)**: The Father of Modern Linguistics. He defined the **Chomsky Hierarchy** of Grammars. We use his hierarchy to define the complexity of our Schema validation (Regular vs Context-Free).

*   **The King's Foot**: The first standardized measurement.
*   **The Subak Manual**: The ancient protocol involves specific water measurements.
*   **The Meter (1799)**: Defined by the Earth itself (or a Platinum bar).
*   **Protocol Buffers / JSON Schema**: The modern Grammar of data exchange.

## 4. Technical Implementation: The Type System
The **Brain Factory** enforces strict typing.
*   **Mechanism**: **IPLD Schemas** for MCards.
*   **Role**: Ensures that an "Agent Skill" printed in Jakarta works in Papua.
*   **Sovereignty**: We define our own Types; we do not accept the "API of the Colonizer" blindly.

### 4.1 Universal Grammar: The Arithmetization of Correctness
In the **Universal Grammar**, The Schema defines the **Region of Convergence**:
$$ \text{Correctness} = \text{Integrability} + \text{Boundedness} $$
*   **Empty Schema Principle**: We start with the **Unit Type** ($\top$)—the empty container. We only add complexity (fields) if we can afford the verification cost.
*   **Types as Budgets**: A Schema is not just a shape; it is a **Thermodynamic Constraint**.
    *   **Int8**: "I dedicate exactly 8 bits of entropy to this truth."
    *   **String(N)**: "I dedicate variable energy bounded by $N$."
*   **Curry-Howard Economics**: A Type is a Promise; a Program is the Proof. A Schema is a contract that guarantees the program will terminate (converge) within the energy budget.

## 5. Operational Flow (Faster Interactive Learning)
How does **The Schema** sustain **[[Hub/Theory/Integration/Flow in PKC - Faster Interactive Learning|Flow State]]**?

*   **Gradual Typing (Empty Schema)**: We do not demand "Strict Schemas" on Day 1. Ideas start as "Dynamic Types" (JSON blobs) to capture Rhythm. As the project matures, the user "hardens" the schema into "Static Types" (Strict Structs). The system supports this smooth evolution from Sketch to Standard.
*   **Instant Validation (Local-first)**: The "Type Checker" runs locally in the background, providing **<16ms** feedback on correctness. The user sees errors as "Red Squiggles" instantly, allowing them to fix grammar without breaking the train of thought.

> **"If you define the Schema, you define the Cost Structure. Sovereignty is the right to reject data you cannot afford to process."**
