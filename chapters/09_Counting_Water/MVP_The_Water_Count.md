# MVP: The Schema (Water Count)

> *"Grammar is the law of meaning. In the Brain Factory, if data does not fit the Schema, it is noise."*

## 1. The Brain Factory Role: Standardization
**The Schema** (Grammar of Arithmetic) is the rigid definition of Truth. It defines the "Types" of the Brain Factory.
*   **Input**: Empirical Counts (Ch 1) and Logic (Ch 5).
*   **Operation**: Formalization (Type Definition).
*   **Output**: An **[[MCard Schema]]** (The rules of the ledger).

## 2. GASing Strategy
*   **Menyenangkan (Rhetoric)**: "The Rules of the Game." Every game needs rules to be fair.
*   **Asyik (Logic)**: The "Game" of **Parsing**. Fitting the square peg in the square hole.
*   **Gampang (Grammar)**: **Type Theory**. `data Water = Liters Float | Drops Int`.

## 3. Historic Verification (The Commit Log)
We ground this in the history of **Standardization**.

### Historical Anchors
1.  **Gottlob Frege (1848–1925)**: The Father of Analytic Philosophy. He attempted to derive all arithmetic from logic. While Gödel showed limits, Frege's rigorous **Schema** definition underpins our Token Types.
2.  **Alonzo Church (1903–1995)**: The creator of **Lambda Calculus**. He proved that "Computation" is just the manipulation of symbols according to Grammar. His logic powers our **Functional Specs**.
3.  **Noam Chomsky (1928–)**: The Father of Modern Linguistics. He defined the **Chomsky Hierarchy** of Grammars. We use his hierarchy to define the complexity of our Schema validation (Regular vs Context-Free).

*   **The King's Foot**: The first standardized measurement.
*   **The Subak Manual**: The ancient protocol involves specific water measurements.
*   **The Meter (1799)**: Defined by the Earth itself (or a Platinum bar).
*   **Protocol Buffers / JSON Schema**: The modern Grammar of data exchange.

## 4. Technical Implementation: The Type System
The **Brain Factory** enforces strict typing.
*   **Mechanism**: **IPLD Schemas** for MCards.
*   **Role**: Ensures that an "Agent Skill" printed in Jakarta works in Papua.
*   **Sovereignty**: We define our own Types; we do not accept the "API of the Colonizer" blindly.

> **"If you define the Schema, you define the Reality. Sovereignty is the right to define your own Types."**
