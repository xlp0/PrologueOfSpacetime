# The Drone Explorer: Astrobiology in Action

**Hardware Focus**: Drones / Rovers (The Explorer)
**Curriculum Column**: Astrobiology (Spacetime)

## 1. The Philosophy of Exploration
In **Search Theory**, looking for information is a trade-off between **Exploitation** (staying where you know it's safe) and **Exploration** (risking the unknown for a better reward).
*   **The Drone**: An agent sent into the unknown.
*   **The Return**: The critical requirement. Data requires a round-trip to be useful.

## 2. Astrobiological Exercises

### Exercise A: The Fog of War
*   **Concept**: Partial Information.
*   **Task**: Navigate a rover through a maze without a map, building the map as you go (SLAM - Simultaneous Localization and Mapping).
*   **Lesson**: You never know the Global Truth, only your Local Trajectory.

### Exercise B: Biosignature Detection
*   **Concept**: Pattern Recognition.
*   **Task**: Use a drone's camera to identify a specific color or QR code (Simulation of "Life") in a field of noise.
*   **Lesson**: Life is low-entropy structure in a high-entropy universe.

### Exercise C: The Return Trip
*   **Concept**: Thermodynamics/Battery Life.
*   **Task**: Program a mission that must return to base before power reaches 0%.
*   **Lesson**: Survival is an energy equation. A dead explorer tells no tales.

## 3. Technical Implementation
*   **IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)**: The inner ear of the drone (Accelerometer/Gyro).
*   **Computer Vision**: How the drone "Sens" the world.
*   **State Estimation**: Kalman Filtering—guessing where you are when your sensors are noisy.
