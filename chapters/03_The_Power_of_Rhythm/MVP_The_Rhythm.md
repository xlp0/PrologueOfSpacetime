# MVP Card: The Rhythm

> *"Time is not a line, but a heartbeat. To work together, we must pulse together."*

## 0. The Monad as Archetype
**The Rhythm** is the Monad of **Time**. It discretizes the continuous flow of time into actionable "beats".

## 1. The Principle (Abstract Dimension)
**The Rhythm** represents **Music**: Number in Time.
*   **Periodicity**: The cycle of events.
*   **Coordination**: Aligning individual actions to a shared clock.

## 2. The Character (Concrete Dimension)
**Role**: The Drummer / The Signal.
**Mechanism**:
*   Broadcasting signals to the village.
*   Marking the phases of the agricultural cycle.

## 3. The Evidence (Balanced Dimension)
**Verification**: The shared action of the farmers arriving and working in unison.

## 4. Narrative Integration
In **Chapter 3**, the User discovers that structure (Shape) and quantity (Counting) differ in *when* they happen. **The Rhythm** aligns the community in time.
