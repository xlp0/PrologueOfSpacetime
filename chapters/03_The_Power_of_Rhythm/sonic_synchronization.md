# Sonic Synchronization: The Resonator

**Hardware Focus**: Mics / Speakers (The Resonator)
**Curriculum Column**: Music (Time)

## 1. The Philosophy of Resonance
In **Distributed Systems**, time is the hardest problem. We usually rely on NTP (Network Time Protocol), but in the physical world, we can use **Sound**.
*   **The Kulkul**: A wooden drum used in Bali to signal "Time to Gather".
*   **The Heartbeat**: A regular pulse (`ack`) that proves life.

## 2. Acoustic Exercises

### Exercise A: The Feedback Loop
*   **Concept**: Recursion.
*   **Task**: Create a simple microphone-to-speaker loop.
*   **Lesson**: When Output becomes Input, you get **Oscillation** (Life) or **Screeching** (Chaos). Control variables (Gain) manage this balance.

### Exercise B: The Doppler Effect
*   **Concept**: Relative Time.
*   **Task**: Move a sound source towards a microphone.
*   **Lesson**: Observation changes the data. Velocity affects perceived frequency.

### Exercise C: The Acoustic Clock
*   **Concept**: Synchronization.
*   **Task**: Use a "Clap" to sync two independent recording devices.
*   **Lesson**: A single loud event can serve as a "Genesis Block" for a timeline, aligning all observers.

## 3. Technical Implementation
*   **Sampling Rate**: The "Tick Rate" of reality (44.1kHz).
*   **FFT (Fast Fourier Transform)**: Converting "Time Domain" (Waveform) to "Frequency Domain" (Spectrum).
*   **Latency**: The gap between "Event" and "Hearing".
