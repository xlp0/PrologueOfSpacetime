# Chapter 5: Resource Allocation (The Token Economy)
**Phase**: Logic (Process/What)
**Subject**: Arithmetic / Efficiency

> *"To optimize is to understand cost."*

> [!NOTE]
> This chapter serves as the "Logic" phase of the Arithmetic column. It deals with how we allocate and optimize the fundamental units (Tokens) defined in the system.

## The Currency of Intelligence
In the Prologue of Spacetime, **Tokens** are the fundamental atoms of meaning.
*   **Universal Grammar**: Allocation is the setting of **Coefficients ($c_k$)** in the polynomial $f = \sum c_k \phi_k$.
*   **Kenosis (Stewardship)**: To allocate is to flow. Hoarding resources ($c_k \to \infty$) creates a singularity; distributing them creates life.
*   **The Token**: Just as the "Drop" is the unit of water, the "Token" is the unit of thought-energy.

### 2. Project: Kinetic Node (Phase 2)
We apply resource allocation to **Physical Energy**.
*   **[IoT Motor Control](iot_motor_control.md)**: Allocating voltage to motors to animate the Ch 02 Frame.

### Why It Matters

Understanding tokens is crucial for three primary reasons:

1.  **Cost Implications**: We are billed by the token. Every unit processed has a real-world cost.
2.  **Performance Optimization**: Larger vocabularies allow for more efficient encoding (fewer tokens for the same meaning).
3.  **Language Bias**: Common languages (JavaScript, English) are "cheaper" to process than rare ones (Haskell, "Frabjous"), creating a structural bias in the intelligence economy.

## Technical Deep Dive

## The Memory-Compute Tradeoff (Engram)

If "Tokens" are the currency, **Engram** is the Vault. It solves the inefficiency of using expensive "Reasoning" (System 2 / GPU) to perform simple "Recall" (System 1 / RAM).

*   **Separation of Concerns**: Offloading static knowledge to cheap RAM lookups allows the GPU to focus on complex reasoning.
