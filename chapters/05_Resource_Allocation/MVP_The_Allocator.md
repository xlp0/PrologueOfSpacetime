# MVP Card: The Allocator

> *"Logic is the morality of number. It dictates where the surplus must go."*

## 0. The Monad as Archetype
**The Allocator** applies **Logic** to **Arithmetic**. It is the decision function $f: \text{Resources} \to \text{Distribution}$, converting "Scarcity" into "optimization".

### Logic x Arithmetic
Arithmetic in the Logic layer is about **Resource Allocation**.
*   **Scarcity**: In the Subak, water is finite. Who gets it first?
*   **Computing**: In a network, CPU cycles are finite. Which process runs?
*   **Modular Arithmetic**: Using cycles ($n \pmod k$) for crop rotation and load balancing.

## 1. The Principle (Abstract Dimension)
**The Allocator** represents **Yoneda Arithmetic** (Identity via Relation).
*   **Relation**: You know an object by how it relates to others ($Water \to Field$).
*   **Justice**: The allocation must satisfy the gods (ritual), people (fairness), and nature (sustainability).

### GASing Perspective: Gampang (Easy/Consistent)
*   **Concept**: Fairness is Math.
*   **Why it's Easy**: Greed is complex; Division is simple. By trusting the arithmetic, we remove the emotional complexity.
*   **Motto**: "Trust the math, not the mood."

## 2. The Character (Concrete Dimension)
**Role**: The Steward.
**Mechanism**:
*   **The Divider**: Calculates needs ($Need = Area \times CropType$).
*   **The Weir**: Physical gates that split flow proportionally.

## 3. The Evidence (Balanced Dimension)
**Verification**: No field is parched while another floods.
*   **Audit Trail**: Every decision is recorded in a **Writer Monad** (Log), creating a history of fairness.

## 4. Narrative Integration
In **Chapter 5**, counting is not enough. We must decide.
*   **The Problem**: "100 units of water, 200 units of need."
*   **The Solution**: Deploy **The Allocator**.
*   **The Lesson**: Logic provides the rule for handling Scarcity.
