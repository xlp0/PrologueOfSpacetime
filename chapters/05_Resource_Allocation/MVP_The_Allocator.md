# MVP Card: The Allocator

> *"Logic is the morality of number. It dictates where the surplus must go."*

## 0. The Monad as Archetype
**The Allocator** applies **Logic** to **Arithmetic**. It is the decision function $f: \text{Resources} \to \text{Distribution}$.

## 1. The Principle (Abstract Dimension)
*   **Logic**: The rules of deduction and validity.
*   **Application**: Determining fair shares based on input data (Chapter 1).

## 2. The Character (Concrete Dimension)
**Role**: The Steward.
**Mechanism**:
*   Calculates the needs of each field.
*   Adjusts the flow gates accordingly.

## 3. The Evidence (Balanced Dimension)
**Verification**: No field is parched while another floods.

## 4. Narrative Integration
In **Chapter 5**, counting is not enough. We must decide. **The Allocator** introduces the algorithmic logic of distribution.
