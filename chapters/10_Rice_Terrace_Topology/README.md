# Chapter 10: Rice Terrace Topology (Scaling)

> *"A single terrace is a garden; a mountain of terraces is an engine."*

In the **Revived Quadrivium**, this is **Geometry** in the **Grammar Phase**. It answers: *How do we structure space to handle scale?*

## 📚 Core Concepts

### 1. The Topology (The Monad)
The "Topology" is the hierarchy of connection. It defines how individual nodes relate to the whole.
*   **[MVP Card: The Topology](MVP_The_Topology.md)**: The definition of the Subak system.
*   **Kenosis (Connection)**: To join the network, the node surrenders its isolation. The whole is greater than the sum.
*   **Universal Grammar**: Topology is **Sheaf Theory**. We "glue" local truths into a global structure if Cohomology = 0.

### 2. Project: Kinetic Node (Phase 8 - Scaling)
We apply Grammar to **The Fleet**.

> **Story Step 8: The Cluster**
> *One robot is a toy. Ten robots are a swarm. One thousand robots are a civilization.*

In **Chapter 06**, we connected one node. In **Chapter 10**, we structure the swarm.
*   **The Metaphor**: Kubernetes for the Physical World.
*   **The Task**: Naming schemes (`node-01`, `node-02`) and Subnets.
*   **The Architecture**: Organized cascades, just like water flows from the top terrace to the bottom.
