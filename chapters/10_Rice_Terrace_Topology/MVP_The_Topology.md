# MVP Card: The Topology

> *"Space is the order of coexistences."*

## 0. The Monad as Archetype
**The Topology** applies **Grammar** to **Space**. It maps the relationships between spaces, transforming "Geography" into "Network".

### Grammar x Geometry
Geometry becomes **Topology**. It is the **Formal Structure of Connection**.
*   **The Graph**: Rice terraces are a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
*   **The Mesh**: The sovereign network is a Mesh Graph.
*   **Geometric Foundations**: Manifolds, Coordinate Systems, and Boundaries.

## 1. The Principle (Abstract Dimension)
**The Topology** represents **Structured Geometry**.
*   **Level 2 Maturity**: Scripted Ceremonies. The topology dictates the script ("Because water flows *here*, we perform ritual *there*").
*   **Hard-Coded Paths**: Gravity is non-negotiable.

### GASing Perspective: Asyik (Fun/Relevance)
*   **Concept**: Exploration / Level Design.
*   **Why it's Fun**: A map is a puzzle box. Understanding hidden connections allows for mastery.
*   **Motto**: "The map is the game board."

## 2. The Character (Concrete Dimension)
**Role**: The Architect.
**Mechanism**:
*   **The Map**: A formal MCard defining `Nodes` (Paddies) and `Edges` (Channels).
*   **Capacity**: Defining the maximum flow rate for every edge.

## 3. The Evidence (Balanced Dimension)
**Verification**: A map that correctly predicts flow dependencies.
*   **Observability**: If Block A is poisoned, Block B knows immediately because the topology tracks the link.

## 4. Narrative Integration
In **Chapter 10**, the specific shapes become a connected system.
*   **The Problem**: "The poison upstream killed the fish downstream."
*   **The Solution**: Map **The Topology**.
*   **The Lesson**: Everything is connected; Topology makes the connections visible.
