# MVP: The Topology

> *"Topology is the grammar of space. In the Brain Factory, the Network is the Computer."*

## 1. The Brain Factory Role: Infrastructure Definition
**The Topology** (Grammar of Geometry) defines the *structure* of the network itself.
*   **Input**: The Spatial relationships (Ch 2).
*   **Operation**: Network Architecture Design.
*   **Output**: A **Network Graph** (The "Circuit Board" of the Nation).

## 2. GASing Strategy
*   **Menyenangkan (Rhetoric)**: "The Golden Bridge." Connecting islands.
*   **Asyik (Logic)**: The "Game" of **Bridge Building** (Poly Bridge).
*   **Gampang (Grammar)**: **Graph Theory**. Nodes, Edges, Connectivity, Cuts.

## 3. Historic Verification (The Commit Log)
We ground this in the history of **Infrastructure**.

### Historical Anchors
1.  **Bernhard Riemann (1826–1866)**: The Geometer of Manifolds. He taught us that **Topology** determines the rules of movement. A curved space changes the shortest path. We view the **Mesh Network** as a Riemannian Manifold of Trust.
2.  **Leonard Kleinrock (1934–)**: The Father of **Queueing Theory**. He mathematically proved how message flow works in a network. His math governs our **Topology Design**—balancing capacity and latency.
3.  **Tim Berners-Lee (1955–)**: The Weaver of the Web. He proved that a **Decentralized Topology** (Hypertext) scales infinitely compared to a centralized database. Our **MCardFS** is the modern spiritual successor to his original vision of a Read-Write Web.

*   **The Roman Roads**: Verification of Empire through connection.
*   **The Rice Terrace**: A hydraulic topology that has lasted 1,000 years.
*   **The Internet (BGP)**: The grammar of Global Routing.
*   **The Mesh**: The future of Sovereign connection.

## 4. Technical Implementation: The Mesh
The **Brain Factory** is a **Mesh Network**.
*   **Nodes**: Schools (IT Del, Seminaries).
*   **Protocol**: **Overlay VPN** (WireGuard + Headscale).
*   **Grammar**: The IP Addressing Scheme (IPv6) that identifies every Sovereign Node.
