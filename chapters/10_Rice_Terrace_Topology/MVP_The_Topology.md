# MVP Card: The Topology

> *"The land speaks a language of elevation and flow. We must learn its grammar."*

## 0. The Monad as Archetype
**The Topology** applies **Grammar** to **Space**. It maps the relationships between spaces.

## 1. The Principle (Abstract Dimension)
*   **Rice Terrace Topology**: The hierarchical structure of the irrigation system.
*   **Connectivity**: How upstream affects downstream.

## 2. The Character (Concrete Dimension)
**Role**: The Architect.
**Mechanism**:
*   Mapping the subaks (irrigation societies).
*   Understanding the recursive structure of the watershed.

## 3. The Evidence (Balanced Dimension)
**Verification**: A map that correctly predicts flow dependencies.

## 4. Narrative Integration
In **Chapter 10**, the specific shapes become a connected system. **The Topology** is the grammar of the landscape.
