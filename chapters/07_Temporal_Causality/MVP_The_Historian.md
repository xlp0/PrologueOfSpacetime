# MVP Card: The Historian

> *"The present is the child of the past. Logic tracks the lineage of events."*

## 0. The Monad as Archetype
**The Historian** applies **Logic** to **Time**. It establishes the chain of cause and effect.

## 1. The Principle (Abstract Dimension)
*   **Temporal Causality**: $State_{t+1} = f(State_t, Action)$.
*   **Debugging**: Tracing back from a failure to its root cause.

## 2. The Character (Concrete Dimension)
**Role**: The Scribe.
**Mechanism**:
*   Recording events and outcomes.
*   Analyzing why a harvest failed or succeeded.

## 3. The Evidence (Balanced Dimension)
**Verification**: The ability to explain *why* the current state exists.

## 4. Narrative Integration
In **Chapter 7**, the User learns that actions have consequences. **The Historian** provides the logic to understand time's arrow.
