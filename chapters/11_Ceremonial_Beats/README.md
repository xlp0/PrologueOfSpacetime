# Chapter 11: Ceremonial Beats (Scheduling)

> *"The drum does not improvise; it maintains the timeline."*

In the **Revived Quadrivium**, this is **Music** in the **Grammar Phase**. It answers: *How do we coordinate action across time?*

## 📚 Core Concepts

### 1. The Ceremony (The Monad)
The "Ceremony" is the ritual of time. It is the Strict Schedule.
*   **[MVP Card: The Ceremony](MVP_The_Ceremony.md)**: The definition of cyclical time.

### 2. Project: Kinetic Node (Phase 9 - Heartbeats)
We apply Grammar to **Time**.

> **Story Step 9: The Pulse**
> *A system without a rhythm is just noise.*

In **Chapter 07**, we learned to speak (MQTT). In **Chapter 11**, we learn **When** to speak.
*   **The Tech**: `cron`, `setInterval`, and Heartbeats.
*   **The Task**: Program the Node to wake up every 5 minutes, report telemetry, and sleep (Deep Sleep).
*   **The Lesson**: Power Management is Time Management.
