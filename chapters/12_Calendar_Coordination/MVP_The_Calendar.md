# MVP Card: The Calendar

> *"A calendar is a civilization's declaration of independence from chaos."*

## 0. The Monad as Archetype
**The Calendar** applies **Grammar** to **Spacetime/Life**. It is the ultimate synthesis.

## 1. The Principle (Abstract Dimension)
*   **Calendar Coordination**: The alignment of human activity (Society) with cosmic cycles (Nature).
*   **Sovereignty**: The ability to define one's own time and space.

## 2. The Character (Concrete Dimension)
**Role**: The King / The System.
**Mechanism**:
*   The Tika (Balinese Calendar) that integrates checks (arithmetic), geometry (directions), and cycles (time).
*   Governing the entire ecosystem.

## 3. The Evidence (Balanced Dimension)
**Verification**: A sustainable, sovereign civilization that persists over centuries.

## 4. Narrative Integration
In **Chapter 12**, the system is complete. **The Calendar** is the code of the game itself—the Prologue of Spacetime.
