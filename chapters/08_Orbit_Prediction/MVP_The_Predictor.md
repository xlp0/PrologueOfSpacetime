# MVP Card: The Predictor

> *"We cannot change the stars, but we can prepare for their alignment."*

## 0. The Monad as Archetype
**The Predictor** applies **Logic** to **Spacetime/Life**. It models the future state of the living system.

## 1. The Principle (Abstract Dimension)
*   **Orbit Prediction**: Calculating future positions and states.
*   **Scenario Planning**: "If X happens, do Y."

## 2. The Character (Concrete Dimension)
**Role**: The Oracle / The Simulator.
**Mechanism**:
*   Running models based on past data (History) and current observation (Observer).
*   Predicting pest outbreaks or droughts.

## 3. The Evidence (Balanced Dimension)
**Verification**: Accuracy of the forecast against reality.

## 4. Narrative Integration
In **Chapter 8**, the ultimate logic is foresight. **The Predictor** allows the village to act before the event occurs.
