# Chapter 08: Orbit Prediction

> *"Prophecy is not magic; it is the inevitable result of accurate physics."*

In the **Revived Quadrivium**, **Orbit Prediction** is the Logic of Spacetime. It answers the question: *How do we act today to ensure a specific tomorrow?*

## 📚 Core Concepts

### 1. The Predictor (The Monad)
The "Predictor" is the Intelligence of the system. It takes **History** (Ch 07) and extrapolates it into **Future State**.
*   **[MVP Card: The Predictor](MVP_The_Predictor.md)**: The philosophical definition of foresight.
*   **Kenosis (Prophecy)**: We accept the **Horizon**. We cannot predict past the chaotic singularity (**Born-Infeld Bound**).
*   **Universal Grammar**: Prediction is **Analytic Continuation**. We extend the Taylor Series into the future.

## 2. Technical Implementation: OpenClaw & MCP

Prediction is useless without Action. We use **OpenClaw** (The Agent) and **MCP** (Model Context Protocol) to give our AI hands.

### What is a "Skill" in AI?
In the context of LLMs, a "Skill" is NOT knowledge (that's the model weights). A Skill is a **Tool Definition** that allows the model to execute code.
*   **Knowledge**: "I know how a motor works."
*   **Skill**: `turn_motor_on(speed=255)`

### 3. Project: Kinetic Node (Phase 6)
We apply prediction to **Control**.
*   **[OpenClaw & AI Skills](openclaw_skills.md)**: Defining the `tools` that allow the AI to pilot the Ch 02 Frame.
