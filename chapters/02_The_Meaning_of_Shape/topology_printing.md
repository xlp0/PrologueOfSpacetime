# Topology & The Reifier: 3D Printing as Logic

**Hardware Focus**: 3D Printer (The Reifier)
**Curriculum Column**: Geometry (Space)

## 1. The Philosophy of Reification
In **Type Theory**, a "Type" is an abstract definition. To make it useful in the real world, we must **instantiate** it.
*   **Coding**: `Class -> Object`
*   **Fabrication**: `STL (Mesh) -> Print (Object)`

The 3D Printer is our **Reification Engine**. It forces us to confront the reality of physics (gravity, adhesion, tolerance) just as a compiler forces us to confront the reality of logic.

## 2. Topological Exercises

### Exercise A: The Möbius Strip
*   **Concept**: Non-Orientable Surfaces.
*   **Task**: Print a Möbius strip.
*   **Lesson**: A surface with only one side. This teaches that "Inside" and "Outside" are not always binary.

### Exercise B: The Klein Bottle
*   **Concept**: Manifolds.
*   **Task**: Print a cross-section of a Klein Bottle.
*   **Lesson**: Higher-dimensional geometry projected into 3D space.

## 3. The Project: Printing the Kinetic Frame

> **Story Step 1: Defined Form**
> *We start with the body. Without a body, the spirit has nowhere to dwell.*

To build our **Kinetic Node**, we must first print the exoskeleton.
*   **Task**: Print the `kinetic_node_frame.stl`.
*   **Constraint**: Use 20% infill for strength/weight balance.

### Next Step: Animation
A static frame is just a sculpture. To give it **Agency**, we must add Energy.
