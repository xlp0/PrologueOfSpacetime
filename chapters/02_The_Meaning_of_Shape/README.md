# Chapter 02: The Meaning of Shape

> *"Space is not empty; it is the canvas where boundaries define meaning."*

In the **Revived Quadrivium**, **Geometry** is the study of **Number in Space**. It answers the question: *How do we define boundary, ownership, and relation?*

## 📚 Core Concepts

### 1. The Shape (The Monad)
The "Shape" is the fundamental unit of Geometry. In our curriculum, we move beyond Euclidean planes to understand **Topics**, **Graphs**, and **Networks**.
*   **[MVP Card: The Shape](MVP_The_Shape.md)**: The philosophical definition of space.

### 2. Hardware Integration: The Reifier (3D Printing)
To understand abstract topology, we must make it physical. We use **3D Printing** to "reify" (make real) our abstract types.
*   **[Topology & 3D Printing](topology_printing.md)**: A guide to slicing, non-Euclidean geometry, and physicalizing code.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
1.  **Understand Topology**: How connectedness matters more than distance.
2.  **Fabrication**: Learning to operate the "Reifier" (3D Printer).
3.  **Spatial Logic**: Defining boundaries that are enforceable (Smart Contracts).
