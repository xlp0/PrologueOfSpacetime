# MVP Card: The Shape

> *"Space is not empty; it is the canvas where boundaries define meaning."*

## 0. The Monad as Archetype
**The Shape** is an instance of the **Monadic Archetype**. It defines the "Container" in terms of spatial extent.

## 1. The Principle (Abstract Dimension)
**The Shape** represents **Geometry**: the study of magnitude at rest.
*   **Horizontal Composition**: $Area = Length \times Width$.
*   **Significance**: Without shape, there is no "Here" or "There".

## 2. The Character (Concrete Dimension)
**Role**: The Surveyor.
**Mechanism**:
*   Defining the boundaries of the rice paddies.
*   Ensuring each field has a defined topological existence.

## 3. The Evidence (Balanced Dimension)
**Verification**: The physical dikes and markers that separate fields.

## 4. Narrative Integration
In **Chapter 2**, the User learns that counting water is useless if we don't know *where* it is going. The **Shape** gives the water a destination.
