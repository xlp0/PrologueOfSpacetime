# MVP Card: The Navigator

> *"To know the shape is one thing; to traverse it is another."*

## 0. The Monad as Archetype
**The Navigator** applies **Logic** to **Space**. It solves the graph traversal problem.

## 1. The Principle (Abstract Dimension)
*   **Network Pathfinding**: Finding the optimal route through a topology.
*   **Graph Theory**: Nodes (Fields) and Edges (Canals).

## 2. The Character (Concrete Dimension)
**Role**: The Engineer.
**Mechanism**:
*   Designing the canal layout to minimize loss.
*   Routing water through gravity.

## 3. The Evidence (Balanced Dimension)
**Verification**: Water reaches the furthest field with minimal leakage.

## 4. Narrative Integration
In **Chapter 6**, the User deals with the complexity of the network. **The Navigator** provides the logic to connect shapes efficiently.
