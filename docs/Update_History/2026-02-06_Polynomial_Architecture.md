# The Polynomial Architecture Update

## Overview
This update represents a major paradigmatic shift in the **Prologue of Spacetime** documentation. We have moved from a purely **Educational Metaphor** (The Trivium/Quadrivium) to a rigorous **Mathematical and Economic Engine** based on **Polynomial Functors** and **Bounded Rationality**.

The core insight is that **Sovereignty is an Economic Function**. It is the ability to define a **Region of Convergence (ROC)** where one's available resources (Compute, Energy, Attention) are sufficient to maintain **Truth** (Identity) against Entropy.

## Key Architectural Changes

### 1. The Universal Grammar of Decomposition
We have formalized the project's logic using the **Polynomial Functor**:
$$ P(X) = \sum_{i \in I} A_i \times X^{B_i} $$
This is not just notation; it is the **Conservation Law** of our system.
*   **$A_i$ (Position)**: The State (MCard). Requires **Storage Energy**.
*   **$X^{B_i}$ (Direction)**: The Choice (PCard). Requires **Compute Energy**.
*   **Boundedness**: The sum is finite. We explicitly reject "Unbounded" infinites.

### 2. Resource as Damping (Laplace Transform)
We have integrated the **Laplace Transform** ($\mathscr{L}\{f(t)\} = \int e^{-\sigma t}$) as the operational definition of the **Allocator**.
*   **$\sigma$ (Sigma)**: The Cost Function.
*   **Damping**: Any future that costs more than our "Energy Budget" is damped to zero.
*   **Result**: We no longer "Hallucinate" impossible futures; we only process what is "Affordable."

### 3. Accounting as Verification
**Verification** (VCard) is now defined as **Accounting**.
*   It is the audit of the **Energy Transaction**.
*   Did the Input Energy (Resource) $\to$ Valid Output (Truth)?
*   If yes, the VCard is the **Receipt**.

### 4. Chapter-by-Chapter Integration
All 12 Chapters of the MVP have been updated to reflect this **Economic/Polynomial** reality:

| Chapter | Component | New Concept |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **01 Counter** | MCard | **Existential Accounting**: Count = Storage Cost. |
| **02 Shape** | Topology | **Spatial Boundedness**: Topology = Memory Budget. |
| **03 Rhythm** | PCard | **Temporal Damping**: Frequency = Energy Cost. |
| **04 Observer** | VCard | **Cost of Truth**: Verification = Paid Compute. |
| **05 Allocator** | Scheduler | **Laplace Damping**: $\sigma$ filters the Impossible. |
| **06 Navigator** | Router | **Impedance Matching**: Path Energy optimization. |
| **07 Historian** | Log | **Historical Compression**: Causal Chain vs. Noise. |
| **08 Predictor** | Model | **Economic Horizon**: Prediction Value > Calc Cost. |
| **09 Schema** | Type | **Type Economy**: Schema as Budget Constraint. |
| **10 Mesh** | Network | **Maintenance Costs**: Sheaf gluing costs. |
| **11 Ceremony** | Protocol | **Ritual Economy**: Habits reduce Energy load. |
| **12 Calendar** | Roadmap | **Temporal Budget**: Aligning with Solar Cycles. |

## Conclusion
This update transforms the **Brain Factory** from a "School" into a **Sovereign Economic Engine**. Students are not just learning "Coding"; they are learning the **Physics of Information**—how to turn Energy into Truth without going bankrupt (Diverging).
