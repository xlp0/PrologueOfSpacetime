# BMAD Method & Prompt Engineering Activity Guide

## **Session Overview**
**Objective**: Learn BMAD Method fundamentals, prompt engineering basics, and create PRD documents using AI agents

## **What Students Will Learn**
- BMAD Method fundamentals and concepts
- Prompt engineering techniques and best practices
- What is a PRD (Product Requirements Document)
- Story Master, Developer, and QA agent roles
- Agentic workflow orchestration basics
- Integration of BMAD Method with IoT-PKC systems

## **Project Rules**
- All teams must implement BMAD Method in their projects
- Each team must have Story Master, Developer, and QA agents configured
- Teams must create a PRD document using AI agents
- All prompts must follow engineering best practices
- BMAD workflows must integrate with existing IoT-PKC systems
- Documentation must track all agent interactions and decisions
