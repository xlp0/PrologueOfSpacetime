# Strategic Todo List: Father's Directives (Feb 16, 2026)

> **Core Philosophy**: "Be Empty of your Self, and make everyone play."
> **Deadline**: Next 3 Months (for initial showcase).

## 1. The Platform (CI/CD & Instrumentation)
- [ ] **Implement CI/CD Process**: Focus on "Empty of Self" automation. The platform must run autonomously.
- [ ] **Grafana Dashboard Implementation**:
    - [ ] Create a **Real-Time Scoreboard** (Game Score Board).
    - [ ] Visualize Participant Status.
    - [ ] Visualize Location Distribution (Map).
    - [ ] Track number of participants.
- [ ] **OpenClaw Integration**:
    - [ ] Enable continuous code refinement (24/7 loops), even while sleeping.

## 2. The Curriculum (Game Creation)
- [ ] **Design "Game Creating Curriculum"**: Instead of just playing games, teach how to *create* games.
- [ ] **Create Samples and Tutorials**: Use existing content (Father's references) as the base.
- [ ] **Hardware & IoT Implementation (Instrumentation)**:
    - **Oscilloscope (Arduino)**:
        - [ ] Create Arduino Sketch (Uno/Nano) for signal visualization.
        - [ ] Print 3D Case.
        - [ ] **Demo Video**: Due in 2 Days.
    - **VR Lenses**:
        - [ ] Receive 4 pairs (Arriving Today).
        - [ ] Integrate into Goggles.
    - **Telescope**:
        - [ ] Receive Lenses (Arriving Saturday).
        - [ ] Build Tube Assembly.
    - **Microscope**:
        - [ ] Source Seller.
    - **360 Antigravity A1 Drone**:
        - [ ] Write Story Integration (Synthesist/Observer).
        - [ ] Source Components (Flight Controller, Camera).
        - [ ] Integrate with VR Goggles (FPV Feed).
- [ ] **Define Quadrivium Subjects**:
    - [ ] Mathematics.
    - [ ] Engineering.
    - [ ] Arts.
    - [ ] Astrobiology.

## 3. Sovereign Knowledge Management (PKC)
- [ ] **Single Source of Truth (SSOT)**:
    - [ ] Create **One MCard Collection** (Database File) that captures ALL knowledge.
    - [ ] Treat MCard as a **New Currency** in the game.
- [ ] **Automated Content Management**:
    - [ ] Use AI to generate summaries at every stage.
    - [ ] Demonstrate "Manage Sovereign Knowledge" capabilities.
- [ ] **Daily Log Implementation**:
    - [ ] Use the Daily Log as a storytelling mechanism (Reference -> Learning -> Creation).
    - [ ] Document the journey of learning **Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT)**.

## 4. Theoretical Grounding (The Meta-Language)
- [ ] **Ground Everything in CLM (Cubical Logic Model)**: Correctness tracking via Instrumentation.
- [ ] **Computational Trinitarianism**:
    - [ ] Electromagnetism.
    - [ ] Neural Network-like Language Models.
    - [ ] Categorical Logic (Curry-Howard-Lambek Correspondence).

## 5. Research & References
- [ ] **Game Design Study**: Analyze "Black Myth: Wukong" (Why is it popular?).
- [ ] **Required Reading**:
    - [ ] *Blindsight* (Peter Watts).
    - [ ] Umberto Eco.
    - [ ] Yuval Noah Harari (Understand the 6-year urgency).
- [ ] **Action**: Read deeply, take notes in Notebook/Obsidian/PKC, and absorb into game design.

## 6. The Narrative & Rhetoric (Making Meaning)
- [ ] **Story Outline & Planning**:
    - [ ] Link every gadget/task to **Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT)** and **SSOT**.
    - [ ] Update **Daily Report**: Must include links to Repo, Budget, and Plan. Use it as an *instrument* of action, not just a log.
- [ ] **Character Definitions**:
    - [x] **Linguists**: Define *why* they are the avatars (PersonaPlex/Agents making sense). (See: `docs/narrative/why_linguists.md`)
    - [x] **Digital Synesthesia**: Define as High-Speed Categorization (HoTT Types). (See: `docs/narrative/digital_synesthesia.md`)
    - [ ] **Rorschach**: Define who they are (Entropy? Cloud Collapse? The unintelligible reality?).
    - [ ] **Computational Trinitarianism**: Explain *why* the gadgets (Oscilloscope) relate to Logic and Category Theory.
- [ ] **Action-Oriented Learning**:
    - [ ] Framework: "Governing your own time."
    - [ ] Goal: Wake up from laziness/shallowness.
    - [ ] Method: Use "Rhetoric" to creating urgency (like Alex Wei video) from facts.
