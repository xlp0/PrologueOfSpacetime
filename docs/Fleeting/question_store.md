How can we further simplify the "Reverse Trivium" concept for a non-technical audience without losing the core message?

To simplify the "Reverse Trivium" for a non-technical audience, we must strip away the academic terminology (like "Polynomial Type Runtime" or "Path Integrals") and focus on the universal human experience of learning.
The core message is simple: Don't memorize the rule until you need to solve the problem.
Here are three ways to simplify this concept, drawing directly from your sources:
1. The "Video Game" Analogy (The Gamer’s Journey)
This is the most relatable simplification, leveraging the "Gamifying the Reverse Trivium" source.
• The Old Way (Grammar-First): Imagine buying a video game, but before you are allowed to play, you must read the entire 500-page instruction manual and memorize every item's stat block. You would get bored and quit.
• The Reverse Trivium Way:
    1. Play (Rhetoric): You jump into the game. You have a mission: "Build a house to survive the night." You don't know the rules yet, but you know why you are there.
    2. Struggle & Pattern (Logic): You try to build a roof, but it collapses. You try again. You notice that wood burns and stone doesn't. You are discovering the "logic" of the world through trial and error.
    3. Mastery (Grammar): Only after you’ve played for hours do you look up the "Wiki" or the code to optimize your build. Now, the technical formulas make sense because you have the experience to anchor them.
The Pitch: "We stop forcing students to read the manual before they've played the game."
2. The "Village Problem" Narrative (The Hero’s Arc)
This approach anchors learning in social value rather than abstract requirements.
• The Hook: instead of saying "Today we learn Cryptography," we ask, "How do we stop strangers from reading our village's private messages?".
• Step 1: The Need (Rhetoric/VCard): We establish who needs help and why. "Our village needs a secret code." This creates emotional buy-in.
• Step 2: The Discovery (Logic/PCard): We try passing notes, but they get intercepted. We try simple passwords, but they get guessed. We discover we need a "lock" that everyone can close, but only one person can open.
• Step 3: The Rule (Grammar/MCard): Only now does the teacher say, "The mathematical name for that lock is Public Key Encryption." The student welcomes the technical term because it names a solution they already desperately want.
The Pitch: "We don't teach answers to questions you haven't asked yet."
3. The "Language Immersion" Metaphor (The Natural Path)
This connects to the concept of "Ethnoarithmetics" and "Fluency before Abstraction".
• The Old Way: Memorizing conjugation tables and vocabulary lists for a language you never speak.
• The Reverse Trivium:
    1. Immersion (Rhetoric): You are dropped in a foreign market. You are hungry. You need to communicate to eat. The "Value" is survival.
    2. Pattern Recognition (Logic): You notice everyone says "Sila" when asking for something. You realize "Sila" implies politeness. You didn't read a rulebook; you sensed the pattern.
    3. Formalization (Grammar): Later, a teacher explains why the verb changes form. You say, "Aha! That explains what I heard in the market."
The Pitch: "We teach science the way you learned your native language: Context first, Grammar last."
Summary for the Presentation Slide
If you need to present this on a single slide for a general audience, use the "Why → How → What" frame:
• Traditional School (The Old Way): Starts with WHAT (Memorize these facts). Then HOW (Solve this equation). Maybe someday WHY (Apply it to life).
    ◦ Result: Boredom and forgetting.
• The Prologue of Spacetime (The New Way):
    ◦ 1. WHY (Rhetoric): Start with a crisis. "The network is down, and the village is cut off."
    ◦ 2. HOW (Logic): Experiment with solutions. "We need to prioritize video traffic over downloads."
    ◦ 3. WHAT (Grammar): Formalize the tool. "This is called Quality of Service (QoS) Coding."
The Core Message: In an age where AI can give us any answer, the most important skill is not knowing the "What" (Grammar), but understanding the "Why" (Context) so we can judge if the AI is telling the truth.

How does Digital Synesthesia provide haptic feedback for group dynamics?
What are some specific, high-impact examples of "Digital Synesthesia" that would resonate with an educational audience (e.g., specific sonification examples)?

Based on the "Revived Quadrivium" and "Digital Synesthesia" documents in your sources, here are specific, high-impact examples of Digital Synesthesia designed to resonate with an educational audience.
These examples function by converting abstract data (logic/math/social dynamics) into "Artificial Materiality"—feedback that students can feel, see, or hear, thereby creating a "sensorimotor" intuition before formal learning takes place.
1. The "Fog of Selfishness" (Social Physics & Haptics)
This example is designed to teach social collaboration and governance without lecturing students on ethics. It treats the classroom as a "Social Metamaterial."
• The Setup: A group of students works on a digital collaborative task (e.g., a game or problem-solving simulation).
• The Input: Sensors (microphones for voice turn-taking, proximity sensors) and game telemetry measure the "Idea Flow" and "Social Phase" of the group. AI analyzes if the group is balanced (Equity/Mesh) or dominated by one person (Dictatorship/Centralization).
• The Synesthetic Feedback:
    ◦ Visual: If one student dominates the conversation or the group fails to listen to one another, the shared screen physically fills with a "digital smog" or dark fog. This obscures the problem they are trying to solve,.
    ◦ Haptic: The students' game controllers begin to vibrate with a jarring, irregular rhythm (dissonance). This creates a physical sensation of "heaviness" or resistance,.
• The Educational Outcome: The group physically feels the broken social lattice. To "clear the fog" and stop the vibration, they must instinctively "re-tune" their behavior—passing the microphone, listening more, or decentralizing control—effectively acting as "Biofeedback for Society",.
2. "The Heartbeat of the System" (Sonification of Observability)
This example teaches Systems Engineering and Time-Series Analysis (Music) by converting system metrics into audio.
• The Setup: Students are monitoring a complex digital system (like a school network or a simulated server farm) using tools like Prometheus (the live performance) and Grafana (the score),.
• The Input: Real-time data streams regarding latency, error rates, and CPU load.
• The Synesthetic Feedback:
    ◦ Rhythm & Pitch: Normal operations produce a harmonic, rhythmic hum. As the system nears capacity or encounters errors, the pitch shifts into dissonance, or the rhythm creates "polyrhythmic chaos."
    ◦ Aliasing Lesson: If students set their data "sampling rate" too low, they will literally hear Aliasing—a distortion where high-frequency signals (transient opportunities or errors) are lost or warped into lower frequencies. This teaches the concept that "Resolution = Awareness" through the ear, not just a graph,.
• The Educational Outcome: Students learn to diagnose system health by "listening to the heartbeat" of the infrastructure, realizing that Music is simply "Number in Time" applied to system observability.
3. "Cosmic Harmony" (Astrobiology & Orbital Resonance)
This example connects Arithmetic (Ratios) to Astronomy (Orbits) through Music, helping students intuit the stability of systems.
• The Setup: Students study the solar system or exoplanetary systems.
• The Input: The orbital periods of planets (e.g., Jupiter and its moons, or TRAPPIST-1).
• The Synesthetic Feedback:
    ◦ Sonification: The orbital periods are sped up into the audible range. Stable orbits often exhibit integer ratios (e.g., 2:1, 3:2), which the human ear hears as musical harmony (octaves, perfect fifths),.
    ◦ Dissonance as Instability: Unstable orbits that would lead to planetary collisions sound "out of tune" or chaotic.
• The Educational Outcome: Students perform a "Community Concert of Cosmic Music," deriving aesthetic beauty from raw astronomical data. They learn that "stable systems sing," grounding abstract orbital mechanics in an immediate sensory experience of harmony.
4. "The Resistance of Code" (Haptic Geometry)
This example teaches Geometry and Logic by giving abstract code physical mass.
• The Setup: Students are programming a drone path or a geometric structure in a game engine.
• The Input: The code logic defining vectors, collisions, and constraints.
• The Synesthetic Feedback:
    ◦ Artificial Materiality: If the code contains logic errors (e.g., dividing by zero, intersecting solid meshes), the interface provides force-feedback. The mouse or controller becomes "heavy" or "stuck," resisting the user's attempt to execute the command.
    ◦ Visual Impedance: Inefficient code might render the game world "foggy" or "sluggish," translating computational inefficiency into environmental friction.
• The Educational Outcome: Students learn that logic is not arbitrary; it has "structural integrity." Just as a nail bends if hammered wrong, code "pushes back" when it violates the geometry of the system.

Can we hear the heartbeat of a network through system sonification?
How does the 'Fog of Selfishness' help groups instinctively re-tune their behavior?
Are there any historical precedents for "Arithmetization of Learning" that we can cite to strengthen our theoretical pillar?

Based on the provided sources, specifically the documents on the Revived Quadrivium, Science of Governance, and Ethnoarithmetics, here are the historical precedents you can cite to strengthen the theoretical pillar of "Arithmetization of Learning":
1. The Classical Quadrivium (Medieval & Ancient)
The most direct precedent is the medieval Quadrivium itself, which structured all higher knowledge around four mathematical arts. Your "Revived Quadrivium" updates this by explicitly positioning Arithmetic not just as one of the four, but as the "Universal Abstract System" that encodes the others.
• The Precedent: The classical view defined Arithmetic as "Number in itself," which served as the foundation for Geometry (Number in Space), Music (Number in Time), and Astronomy (Number in Spacetime/Motion).
• The Argument: Just as the medievals believed you could not understand the cosmos (Astronomy) or harmony (Music) without the "code" of Arithmetic, your architecture posits that Arithmetic is the "logic of correctness" required to verify all other domains.
2. Pythagoreanism ("All is Number")
Your documents explicitly cite the Pythagorean tradition as the philosophical root of this worldview.
• The Precedent: The maxim "All is Number" (attributed to Pythagoras) posits that the fundamental reality of the universe is numerical/structural rather than material.
• The Argument: This aligns with your thesis that structure determines dynamics (as seen in Metamaterials and Phase Space). By teaching Arithmetic as the "Code of Reality", you are reviving the Pythagorean insight that to learn a subject is to possess its optimal arithmetic encoding.
3. The Song Dynasty "Fish-Scale Map Registers" (960–1279 CE)
This is a powerful historical example of how "arithmetizing" a physical domain (land) transforms how it is learned, managed, and governed.
• The Precedent: The Fish-scale Map Registers (魚鱗圖冊) were a sophisticated land documentation system that mapped topological relationships and quantified land attributes (size, quality).
• The Argument: This "representational technology" allowed the state to "learn" the reality of its resources in a way that was previously impossible, shifting governance from head taxes to land taxes. It proves that representability (arithmetization) enables accountability and management.
4. Indigenous "Ethnoarithmetics" (Global)
To show that this is a universal human cognitive pattern, not just a Western one, cite Ethnoarithmetics.
• The Precedent: Indigenous systems utilized sophisticated computational algorithms for ritual and decision-making:
    ◦ Ifa Divination (Yoruba): A 256-symbol binary system used for "decision-making algorithms".
    ◦ I-Ching (China): A 64-state computational system for pattern recognition.
    ◦ Vedic Altars (India): Geometric algorithms for creating sacred space.
• The Argument: These demonstrate that humans naturally use "Sacred Algorithms" (arithmetic structures) to engage with complexity and extract meaning (learning).
5. Leibniz’s Monadology (17th Century)
Your sources connect the Single Source of Truth (SSOT) and Personal Knowledge Container (PKC) concepts to Leibniz.
• The Precedent: Leibniz’s Monadology describes reality as composed of "Monads"—simple, indivisible, self-contained units that reflect the entire universe.
• The Argument: This prefigures the "Singleton" pattern and the PKC as a self-sovereign node. It supports the idea that learning systems must be built from "atomic units" (like Monads/Cards) that are structurally complete.
6. Jan Tinbergen’s Econometrics (20th Century)
For a modern policy precedent, cite Jan Tinbergen, the first Nobel Prize winner in Economics.
• The Precedent: The Tinbergen Rule states that to achieve N independent policy objectives, you need at least N independent policy instruments.
• The Argument: This applies "arithmetic rigor" to social governance. It supports your "Science of Governance" claim that learning/governance is a design problem requiring a precise matching of instruments (tools/cards) to objectives (learning outcomes).

How does Arithmetizing Learning prevent the society's education failure?
Why use Arithmetic instead of Geometry to judge correctness?
Can you provide a more concrete analogy for "Product Types" vs "Sum Types" that relates to everyday student life?

Based on the "Revived Quadrivium" and "Homotopy Type Theory" sources, the distinction between Product Types and Sum Types allows us to structure reality. The most concrete analogy for a student relates to The School Lunch (Product) versus The Vending Machine (Sum).
1. Product Types: The "School Lunch Tray" (AND Logic)
Logic: A Product Type (A×B) represents Simultaneity and Co-existence. It requires this AND that to be complete,.
• The Analogy: Imagine a fixed-menu school lunch tray. To have a "Complete Lunch," the tray must contain:
    ◦ A Sandwich AND
    ◦ An Apple AND
    ◦ A Milk Carton.
• Why it fits: These items exist simultaneously in space on the tray. If the milk is missing, the "Product" (the Lunch) is incomplete/broken. In the sources, this maps to Geometry, where a point in space is defined by coordinate x AND coordinate y AND coordinate z all existing at once,.
2. Sum Types: The "Vending Machine" (OR Logic)
Logic: A Sum Type (A+B) represents Choice, Alternatives, or Sequential States. It is this OR that; they cannot happen at the same time,.
• The Analogy: Imagine standing in front of a vending machine with only enough money for one item. You can choose:
    ◦ Chips OR
    ◦ Candy Bar OR
    ◦ Pretzels.
• Why it fits: You cannot select all of them simultaneously; you must pick one "path" or state. In the sources, this maps to Music (Time) because these represent different states or variations that occur sequentially or alternatively (e.g., a note is a C OR a D; you are a Freshman OR a Sophomore),.

What are the most compelling visual demonstrations of "Geometric Algebra" vs "Euclidean Geometry" that we could potentially include in the slide visual?

Based on the sources, specifically the Revived Quadrivium and Geometric Algebra sections, the shift from Euclidean Geometry to Geometric Algebra (GA) is a shift from static axioms to operational arithmetic.
To make this compelling visually for a presentation (specifically Slide 6), you should focus on demonstrating "Magnitude in Motion" and "Structure" rather than static coordinates.
Here are the three most compelling visual demonstrations to include:
1. The "Bivector" vs. The "Normal Vector" (The Unit of Space)
This demonstration visualizes how GA handles 3D planes differently (and better) than traditional geometry.
• The Euclidean/Traditional Visual: Show a flat plane with an arrow sticking straight out of it (the "Normal Vector").
    ◦ The Critique: This is a hack. The arrow points in a direction the plane isn't going. It breaks in 4D or higher dimensions.
• The Geometric Algebra Visual: Show the same plane, but represented as a "Bivector"—an oriented tile with a circular arrow describing "spin" or orientation.
    ◦ The Insight: The Bivector is a "Product of Vectors" (Area). It describes the plane intrinsically, without needing an external coordinate system or an arbitrary normal vector. It represents "magnitude + direction + orientation".
• Slide Caption: Euclid defined planes by what they aren't (normals). Geometric Algebra defines planes by what they are (Bivectors/Spin).
2. The Rotor vs. The Matrix (The Mechanism of Rotation)
This demonstrates the arithmetic efficiency of GA, crucial for the "Game Engine" narrative.
• The Euclidean/Linear Algebra Visual: Display a 3×3 Rotation Matrix. It is a grid of 9 numbers. It is opaque; looking at the numbers gives you no intuition of the axis or angle of rotation.
• The Geometric Algebra Visual: Display a Rotor. Visualize it as an arc connecting two vectors.
    ◦ The Action: Show the equation v 
′
 =RvR 
†
  (the "sandwich product"). Visually demonstrate that multiplying a vector by a Rotor simply "spins" it along that arc.
• Slide Caption: Matrices are data grids. Rotors are arithmetic instructions. We don't calculate coordinates; we multiply vectors.
3. The Geometric Product (The Unification)
This visualizes the "Arithmetic as Universal Interface" concept, showing how GA unifies concepts that students usually learn separately.
• The Split Visual:
    ◦ Left Side (Traditional): Show the Dot Product (Scalar/Projection) and Cross Product (Vector/Perpendicular) as two completely separate, unrelated operations.
    ◦ Right Side (Geometric Algebra): Show the Geometric Product (ab=a⋅b+a∧b).
• The Visual Metaphor: Show two vectors interacting. The result creates a Complex Object that contains both the scalar length (Dot) and the oriented area (Wedge/Bivector) simultaneously.
• Slide Caption: GA unifies the projection (Dot) and the area (Wedge) into a single arithmetic operation.
Recommended Composite Visual for Slide 6
For the specific request in Slide 6 ("Geometry: From Euclid to Game Engines"), use a Wireframe Character Model (Rigging):
1. Overlay Vectors: Green arrows showing velocity/direction.
2. Overlay Bivectors: Yellow oriented planes showing the rotation of joints (e.g., the shoulder or knee hinge).
3. Annotation: Label these as "Arithmetic Operators," not just static points. This connects directly to the "Digital Synesthesia" concept where learners feel the math through game physics.

How do Bivectors and Rotors replace Euclidean geometry in modern games?
How specifically does "Planetary Position" data serve as a "Trustless Verification" layer? Can you verify the technical feasibility of this claim?

Based on the Revived Quadrivium and Sovereign Intelligence Architecture documents, here is the specific mechanism by which "Planetary Position" data serves as a trustless verification layer, along with an assessment of its technical feasibility.
1. How Planetary Positions Serve as "Trustless Verification"
The core premise is that while AI can hallucinate text, images, and code, it cannot alter the physical position of celestial bodies. Therefore, the night sky serves as a "Universal Randomness Beacon" (or technically, a high-entropy, globally visible, immutable state generator) that is accessible to everyone but controlled by no one,.
This effectively turns the Universe into a consensus layer for digital transactions.
The Mechanism: "Proof-of-Observation"
The sources detail a workflow called Proof-of-Observation, which functions similarly to a cryptographic "Proof-of-Work" but relies on physical measurement rather than wasted energy.
1. The Challenge (The Anchor): The system (or a peer) requests verification of a specific celestial event or position (e.g., "What is the Right Ascension of Jupiter right now?").
2. The Observation (The Mining): The student/user does not query a server. They use their Personal Observatory (a "Hardware MCard" consisting of a telescope, Raspberry Pi, and camera sensor) to physically photograph and calculate the position of the planet,.
3. The Verification (The Consensus):
    ◦ Local Check: The captured data is compared against an Ephemeris (a mathematical model of orbital mechanics stored in a PCard) to validate that the object is indeed where physics dictates it should be.
    ◦ Network Check: The observation is cryptographically signed and hashed (creating a VCard). It is then compared against observations from other nodes in the mesh network. If widely distributed observers (e.g., one in Bali, one in Sweden) agree on the vector, the data is validated,.
2. Technical Feasibility Verification
Based on the architectural specifications provided in the sources, this system is highly technically feasible. It relies on integrating three mature technologies:
A. Hardware Feasibility (The "Hardware MCard")
• Requirement: Low-cost, distributed sensors capable of astrophotography.
• Source Evidence: The architecture specifies the use of Raspberry Pi edge nodes connected to commodity camera sensors attached to simple refractors or reflectors,.
• Feasibility: This is standard practice in "Electronically Assisted Astronomy" (EAA). A Raspberry Pi High Quality Camera coupled with open-source software (like Indi/Ekos or simple Python OpenCV scripts) can resolve planetary disks and major moons easily. The cost is low (<$200 for the digital stack), making it scalable for students.
B. Algorithmic Feasibility (The "Ephemeris PCard")
• Requirement: Converting observation data into verifiable coordinates.
• Source Evidence: The curriculum uses Orbital Mechanics simulations (PCards) to predict positions,.
• Feasibility: Algorithms like VSOP87 or libraries like Skyfield/Astropy (Python) allow for high-precision calculation of planetary positions locally on a device without internet access. This enables the "Offline Capability" required by the Local-First principle,.
C. Data Structure Feasibility (The "VCard Witness")
• Requirement: A data format to store and share this proof trustlessly.
• Source Evidence: The system uses a JSON-based "Proof-of-Observation Block".
    ◦ Fields: timestamp, celestial_proof (e.g., jupiter_RA: "2h_15m_32s"), observer_signatures, and merkle_root.
• Feasibility: This is a standard cryptographic verifiable credential structure (similar to W3C Verifiable Credentials). By hashing the observation data (SHA-256) and signing it with the user's DID (Decentralized Identifier), the observation becomes an immutable record,.
Summary of the "Trustless" Claim
The claim is technically sound because it relies on "Computational Trinitarianism",:
1. Type (The Claim): "Jupiter is at vector (x,y,z)."
2. Algorithm (The Physics): Newton/Kepler's laws (encoded in the PCard Ephemeris).
3. Proof (The Witness): The signed image/data from the student's telescope (The VCard).
Because planetary positions cannot be forged by AI, and the laws of physics are immutable and globally consistent, this layer provides a hard physical anchor for digital truth that requires no central authority to maintain.

Can you explain the 'V-P-V Sandwich' architecture of meaning?
Can you generate a JSON schema example for a "VCard" that would prove a specific student achievement (e.g., "Built a Weather Station")?

Based on the MVP Card Architecture described in the Revived Quadrivium and Sovereign Intelligence Architecture documents, a VCard (Verification Card) serves as the "Witness" or "Proof" in the Computational Trinitarianism framework (Type-Algorithm-Proof).
It acts as the Social/Application Plane wrapper that validates the Physical Data (MCard) and the Process Logic (PCard).
Here is a JSON schema example for a Student Achievement VCard (specifically for "Built a Weather Station"), designed to fit into the Personal Knowledge Container (PKC) ecosystem.

Breakdown of the Schema Layers
1. Rhetoric Context (The "Why"):
    ◦ Source: Reverse Trivium Strategy.
    ◦ This section anchors the achievement in Social Meaning. It explains why the student built the station (e.g., for "Village Agriculture"), moving beyond a generic "physics assignment."
2. Logic Process (The "How"):
    ◦ Source: Cubical Logic Model (CLM).
    ◦ This links to the PCard (Process Card) that defines the workflow. It proves the student didn't just buy the station but executed a specific algorithm (Assembly & Calibration). The execution_trace proves the code actually ran.
3. Grammar Evidence (The "What"):
    ◦ Source: MVP Cards / Hardware MCard.
    ◦ This links to MCards (Memory Cards). These are immutable pointers (hashes) to the schematic, the Python code uploaded to the Raspberry Pi, and photo evidence.
    ◦ Telemetry Sample: Shows the device is "alive" and producing valid data (Observability).
4. Consensus Proof (The Witness):
    ◦ Source: Computational Trinitarianism.
    ◦ This is the "Proof" component. It requires two witnesses:
        ▪ IoT Witness: The device itself cryptographically signed a data packet proving it works.
        ▪ Social Witness: A mentor or peer signed off on the calibration.
5. Signature:
    ◦ Source: Sovereignty/PKC.
    ◦ The entire object is signed, making this VCard a portable, self-sovereign asset that the student owns in their PKC, independent of the school's database.

Computational Trinitarianism" is a dense term. Can you suggest 3 alternative names that convey the same "Type/Algo/Proof" triad but might be more accessible?

Based on the sources, particularly the visual breakdowns of Computational Trinitarianism in the context of the ABC Curriculum and MVP Cards, here are three accessible alternative names that convey the "Type/Algorithm/Proof" triad.
1. The Correctness Triad
This term is explicitly used in the visual materials to demystify the concept. It reframes the "Trinity" from a theological or strictly mathematical concept into a practical standard for verifying reality.
• Source Mapping: In the visual guide to assessment, the text explicitly states: "Correctness is a Verifiable Triad.".
• The Accessible Translation:
    ◦ Type → The Spec (What is the claim or proposition?)
    ◦ Algorithm → The Transformation (What is the program or procedure?)
    ◦ Proof → The Audit Trail (What is the witness evidence?)
2. The Spec-Build-Witness Model
This name is derived from the Makerspace/Hardware application of the theory, making it highly relatable to engineers, builders, and students working with physical tools. It shifts the focus from abstract logic to tangible construction.
• Source Mapping: The sources illustrate this by mapping the triad to building a telescope.
    ◦ Type becomes The Spec (The M-Card/Blueprints).
    ◦ Algorithm becomes The Build (The P-Card/Assembly process).
    ◦ Proof becomes The Witness (The V-Card/Certificate that the telescope actually tracks a star).
• Why it works: It moves the concept from "Mathematical Isomorphism" to "Construction and Validation."
3. The Claim-Process-Evidence Cycle
This terminology is adapted from the sections on Assessment and Governance, where the goal is to move from standardized testing to verified portfolios. It frames the triad as a method for establishing truth in a social or educational context.
• Source Mapping: The assessment documentation defines the triad elements functionally:
    ◦ Type is The Claim (The proposition being made).
    ◦ Algorithm is The Code (The workflow or program executed).
    ◦ Proof is The Certificate (The witness produced to verify the claim),.
• Why it works: It strips away the computer science jargon ("Type Theory") and replaces it with forensic or scientific terms ("Evidence" and "Claims") that are intuitive to a general audience.
